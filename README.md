The Column
The Column was created as a capstone project to showcase my full-stack skills. The project idea was spawned from the observation that people love being social and enjoy having limitations on the amount of resources they have. The hopes is that The Column will inspire people to create unique articles that everyone around the world can comment on and relate to. Hope you enjoy!

Summary
This app is used for worldwide conversations. Because the user is only allowed 3 articles per year, they feel the limitations and are pressed to use the articles wisely. This will draw out some fascinating content that can be enjoyed by all cultures. Users can sort the articles by most recent or the most popular, sorting them by the most comments.
